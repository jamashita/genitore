`null` or `undefined`. It is equivalent to None for Optional types and it implements `Heisenberg` interface.

## Lost\<P\>

A class that represents the rejected state for `Heisenberg`. This class contains an exception for the operation that
occurred. It implements `Heisenberg` interface.

# Superposition classes

## (interface) Chrono\<M, R\>

### `Chrono.prototype.accept(valye: Exclude<M, Error>): unknown`

### `Chrono.prototype.catch(errors: Iterable<DeadConstructor<R>>): void`

### `Chrono.prototype.decline(value: R): unknown`

### `Chrono.prototype.getErrors(): Set<DeadConstructor<R>>`

### `Chrono.prototype.throw(cause: unknown): unknown`

## Superposition\<A, D extends Error\>

A class that handles Result of Monad programming asynchronously. This class wraps a `Schrodinger` instance, which
represents the outcome of an asynchronous operation, and can change its state based on the outcome of that operation.

Like `Promise`, the Superposition class can handle multiple states, but it is more finely divided than `Promise`. The
possible states are:

- Successfully fulfilled: corresponds to a fulfilled state of `Promise`.
- Unsuccessfully fulfilled: corresponds to a rejected state of `Promise`, but only for expected errors.
- Rejected: corresponds to a rejected state of `Promise`, but for unexpected errors.
- Pending: corresponds to a pending state of `Promise`.

### `Superposition.all<A, D extends Error>(superpositions: Iterable<Superposition<A, D>>): Superposition<Array<A>, D>`

Takes an `Iterable<Superposition<A, D>>` and returns a single `Superposition<Array<A>, D>`. If all `superpositions` are
in the `Alive` state, the returned instance will be successfully fulfilled with an array of the values from the
`superpositions`. If at least one of `superpositions` is in the `Dead` state, the returned instance will be
unsuccessfully fulfilled with the error from the first `Dead` state encountered. If at least one of `superpositions` is
in the `Contradiction` state, the returned instance will be rejected with the cause from the first `Contradiction` state
encountered. If there are both `Dead` and `Contradiction` states present in the `superpositions`, the returned instance
will be rejected (prioritized).

### `Superposition.anyway<A, D extends Error>(superpositions: Iterable<Superposition<A, D>>): Promise<Array<Schrodinger<A, D>>>`

Retrieves the outcome of each asynchronous operation in `superpositions` by
calling `Superposition.prototype.terminate()` on each item. The resulting `Schrodinger` state for each `Superposition`
can be found in the documentation for `Superposition.prototype.terminate()`.

### `Superposition.of<A, D extends Error>(func: Consumer<Chrono<Awaited<A>, D>>, ...errors: ReadonlyArray<DeadConstructor<D>>): Superposition<Awaited<A>, D>`

Generates a new `Superposition` instance by invoking the provided `func` argument with a `Chrono` object. If
the `Chrono.prototype.accept(value)` is called with a valid value of `Awaited<A>` type, it returns a successfully
fulfilled `Superposition<A, D>`. If the `Chrono.prototype.decline(error)` is called with an error of type `D` that is
specified in the `errors` argument, it returns an unsuccessfully fulfilled `Superposition<A, D>`. If
the `Chrono.prototype.throw(cause)` is called with an argument of `unknown` type, it returns a
rejected `Superposition<A, D>`.

```ts
// let value is type of A or PromiseLike<A>
Superposition.of<A, D>((chrono: Chrono<Awaited<A>, D>) => {
  try {
    if (value.isValid()) {
      chrono.accept(value);

      return;
    }

    chrono.decline(value.error);
  }
  catch (e: unknown) {
    if (e instanceof RuntimeError) {
      chrono.decline(e);

      return;
    }

    chrono.throw(e);
  }
}, RuntimeError);
```

### `Superposition.ofSchrodinger<A, D extends Error>(schrodinger: Schrodinger<Awaited<A>, D>, ...errors: ReadonlyArray<DeadConstructor<D>>): Superposition<Awaited<A>, D>`

Creates a new `Superposition` instance from a given `Schrodinger` instance. The `errors` parameter is an array of error
constructors that can be thrown by the asynchronous operation. If the given `schrodinger` is in the `Alive` state, the
resulting `Superposition` will be successfully fulfilled. If it is in the `Dead` state, it will be unsuccessfully
fulfilled. If it is in the `Contradiction` or `Still` state, it will be rejected.

### `Superposition.ofSuperposition<A, D extends Error>(superposition: ISuperposition<A, D>): Superposition<A, D>`

Generates a new `Superposition` instance from a given `Superposition` instance.

### `Superposition.playground<A, D extends Error>(supplier: Supplier<Exclude<A, Error> | PromiseLike<Exclude<A, Error>>>, ...errors: ReadonlyArray<DeadConstructor<D>>): Superposition<Awaited<A>, D>`

Creates a new `Superposition` instance by executing the provided `supplier`. If the function returns a value of type `A`
or a fulfilled `PromiseLike<A>`, the resulting `Superposition` will be successfully fulfilled. If the function
throws an error or returns a rejected `PromiseLike<A>`, but the error is of a type specified in the `errors` argument,
the resulting `Superposition` will be unsuccessfully fulfilled. If the error is not of a type specified in the `errors`
argument, the resulting `Superposition` will be rejected.

### `Superposition.prototype.get(): Promise<Exclude<A, Error>>`

Retrieves the outcome of the asynchronous operation as a `Promise`. If the instance is in the successfully fulfilled
state, it will return a fulfilled `Promise` instance. If the instance is in the unsuccessfully fulfilled or rejected
state, it will return a rejected `Promise` instance.

### `Superposition.prototype.getErrors(): Set<DeadConstructor<D>>`

Returns a set of error constructors that can be thrown by the asynchronous operation.

### `Superposition.prototype.ifAlive(consumer: Consumer<Exclude<A, Error>>): this`

Executes the given `consumer` with the non-error value of `A` type if the asynchronous operation is going to be
successfully fulfilled.

### `Superposition.prototype.ifContradiction(consumer: Consumer<unknown>): this`

Executes the given `consumer` with the internal `cause` value of `unknown` type if the asynchronous operation is going
to be rejected.

### `Superposition.prototype.ifDead(consumer: Consumer<D>): this`

Executes the given `consumer` with the error value of `D` type if the asynchronous operation is going to be
unsuccessfully fulfilled.

### `Superposition.prototype.map<B = A, E extends Error = D>(mapper: UnaryFunction<Exclude<A, Error>, SReturnType<B, E>>, ...errors: ReadonlyArray<DeadConstructor<E>>): Superposition<B, D | E>`

Executes the given `mapper` only when the current instance is in a successfully fulfilled state. The `mapper` should
take in a single argument of type `Exclude<A, Error>` and should return a value of type `B` without an error, or an
instance of `ISuperposition<B, E>`, a `PromiseLike<Exclude<B, Error>>`, or a `PromiseLike<ISuperposition<B, E>>`.
The return value of this method will be a `Superposition<B, E>` instance if the `mapper` is executed and returns a value
or `Superposition<B, E>` without error, otherwise it will return a `Superposition<B, D>` instance if the `mapper` is not
executed or the returned value contain an error. The overall result will be a `Superposition<B, D | E>` instance.

This method can be used as an alternative to `Promise.prototype.then()`.

```ts
superposition.map<string, SyntaxError>((num: number) => {
  return num.toFixed();
}, SyntaxError).map<number, SyntaxError | TypeError>((str: string) => {
  const num = Number(str);

  if (Number.isNaN(num)) {
    throw new TypeError('NaN');
  }

  return num;
}, TypeError);
```

### `Superposition.prototype.pass(accepted: Consumer<Exclude<A, Error>>, declinded: Consumer<D>, thrown: Consumer<unknown>): this`

Executes the given `accepted` with the non-error value of type `A` when the asynchronous operation is successfully
fulfilled, `declined` with the error value of type `D` when the asynchronous operation is unsuccessfully fulfilled, or
`thrown` with the internal `cause` value of type `unknown` when the asynchronous operation is rejected.

### `Superposition.prototype.peek(peek: Peek): this`

Executes the given `peek` with no arguments when the asynchronous operation represented by the current superposition
instance is completed, regardless of whether it is successfully fulfilled, unsuccessfully fulfilled, or rejected. It
allows you to perform side effects, such as logging, without changing the outcome of the operation.

### `Superposition.prototype.recover<B = A, E extends Error = D>(mapper: UnaryFunction<D>, SReturnType<B, E>>, ...errors: ReadonlyArray<DeadConstructor<E>>): Superposition<B, D | E>`

Executes the given `mapper` only when the current instance is in an unsuccessfully fulfilled state. The `mapper` should
take in a single argument of type `D` and should return a value of type `B` without an error, or an instance of
`ISuperposition<B, E>`, a `PromiseLike<Exclude<B, Error>>`, or a `PromiseLike<ISuperposition<B, E>>`. The return value
of this method will be a `Superposition<B, E>` instance if the `mapper` is executed and returns a value
or `Superposition<B, E>` without error, otherwise it will return a `Superposition<A, E>` instance if the `mapper` is not
executed or the returned value contains an error. The overall result will be a `Superposition<A | B, E>` instance.

This method can be used as an alternative to `Promise.prototype.catch()`.

```ts
superposition.map<string, SyntaxError>((num: number) => {
  return num.toFixed();
}, SyntaxError).map<number, SyntaxError | TypeError>((str: string) => {
  const num = Number(str);

  if (Number.isNaN(num)) {
    throw new TypeError('NaN');
  }

  return num;
}, TypeError).recover<number, Error>((e: SyntaxError | TypeError) => {
  logger.error(e);

  return 1;
});
```

### `Superposition.prototype.terminate(): Promise<Schrodinger<A, D>>`

Terminates the asynchronous operation represented by the current `Superposition` instance and obtain the final state of
the operation represented by a `Schrodinger` instance. If the `Superposition` is successfully fulfilled, the returned
`Schrodinger` will be in the `Alive` state, containing the value of the operation. If the `Superposition` is
unsuccessfully fulfilled, the returned `Schrodinger` will be in the `Dead` state, containing the error that caused the
failure. If the `Superposition` is rejected, the returned `Schrodinger` will be in the `Contradiction` state, indicating
that the operation has been rejected for an unknown reason.

### `Superposition.prototype.transform<B = A, E extends Error = D>(alive: UnaryFunction<Exclude<A, Error>, SReturnType<B, E>>, dead: UnaryFunction<D, SReturnType<B, D>>, ...errors: ReadonlyArray<DeadConstructor<E>>): Superposition<B, E>`

Executes the given `alive` only when the current instance is in a successfully fulfilled state, and also executes the
`dead` only when the current instance is in an unsuccessfully fulfilled state. One of these functions will be executed
unless the current instance is in a rejected state. The overall result will be a `Superposition<B, E>` instance.

This method combines the functionality of `Superposition.prototype.map()` and `Superposition.prototype.recover()` into
one, allowing you to handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes of the asynchronous operation in a single call.
